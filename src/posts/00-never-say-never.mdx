# Never say never

> "There's no way in hell you'll ever get me to step foot in a CrossFit gym."

I spoke those words, verbatim, about three years ago. And, as you probably guesses thanks to the name of this blog, I was wrong. Quite wrong.

These days, I go to CrossFit at least four times a week (five if I'm feeling ambitious and my schedule allows). I recently had to buy a bigger duffel bag to fit my _three_ pairs of CrossFit shoes, grips, lifting belt, and jump rope. (And yes, sometimes I use all of the above in a single WOD).

I'm addicted. I love it. CrossFit is a big part of my life and I am a happier, healthier person because of it.

And sometimes, juste like David Byrne, I ask myself, _How did I get here?_
